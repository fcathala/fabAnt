*Packaging utility for Salesforce professionals - Fabrice Cathala 🐸*

---

**fabAnt** is a simple but efficient packaging utility that simplify moving meta-data packages in between Salesforce orgs. It's built around Salesforce's Ant migration toolkit that it enhances with an old-fashioned script. With fabAnt you can build a package from a change set, pull down the metadata, tweak it and deploy to any org including back into the source. It's also a great way to **build a packages library**.

**fabAnt** is based on the [Force.com Migration Toolkit](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.daas.meta/daas/meta_development.htm) hence will always remains compatible with the latest API version.

>**fabAnt** saves time and reduces risk of manual mistakes. I'm recommending it to any Salesforce implementation teams dealing with lot of packaging work or willing to build a code library.
